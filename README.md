This source code is based on Hyperledger Fabric Samples, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples   

ID-based self-encryption library: https://github.com/ilyagrishkov/ib-self-encryption-rust  
Hyperledger Fabric application: https://github.com/ilyagrishkov/ib-self-encryption

## Installation
* Hyperledger test-network v2.4.3

## Before run
* Deploy the Hyperledger Fabric test-network with certificate authorities (`-ca` flag) based on the instructions: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/test_network.html and create a default channel (`mychannel`)

## Deployment

The smart contract deployment procedure is standard. The instructions can be found here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/test_network.html
